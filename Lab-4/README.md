## Instructions:
For Lab 4, there is a choice of three labs. All three labs will use passenger data from the Titanic. This is a common data set
used in Kaggle competitions. Please choose one of the following labs, or do 2 or all 3 if you have the time. The description of each lab and a pointer to the instructions are documented below. 

1. Watson Machine Learning lab  
2. Watson Studio SPSS Modeler Lab
3. Watson Studio Data Refinery Lab


## Watson Machine Learning Lab (4a)

## Introduction:

In this lab, you will use IBM's Watson Machine Learning GUI to train, evaluate, and deploy a Watson Machine Learning model based on the Titanic dataset.  

## Objectives:

Upon completing the lab, you will:

1. Become familiar with the Watson Machine Learning GUI.  
2. Train/Evaluate a machine learning model
3. Deploy a machine learning model. 
4. Deploy an application that invokes the machine learning model service.

## Watson Studio SPSS Modeler Lab (4b)

## Introduction: 

In this lab, you will use the Watson Studio SPSS Modeler capability to explore, prepare, and model passenger data from the Titanic. The SPSS Modeler is a drag and drop capability to build machine learning pipelines. 

## Objectives: 

Upon completing the lab, you will:

1. Become familiar with the Watson Studio SPSS Modeler capability
2. Profile the Titanic data set 
3. Explore the Titanic data set with visualizations
4. Cleanse and Transform the data 
5. Train/Evaluate a machine learning mode.

## Watson Studio Data Refinery Lab (4c)

## Introduction
In this lab, you will use the Watson Studio Data Refinery to profile data, visualize data, and prepare data for modeling.   

## Objectives 

Upon completing the lab, you will know how to:
1. Profile the data to help determine missing values
1. Visualize the data to gain a better understanding
c. Prepare the data for modeling
d. Run the sequence of data preparation operations on the entire data set.
